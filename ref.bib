 abstract = {Despite increasing popularity of developer dashboards, the effectiveness of dashboards is still in question. In order to design a dashboard that is effective and useful for developers, it is important to know (a) what information developers need to see in a dashboard, and (b) how developers want to use a dashboard with that necessary information. To answer these questions, we conducted two series of face-to-face individual interviews with developers. In the first step we analyzed answers, build a Goal-Question-Metric model and designed a precooked developer dashboard. Then, during the second separate series of interviews, we validated the GQM and derived feedback on the designed dashboard. Given that the cost of dashboard customization prevents developers from utilizing dashboards, we believe that our findings can provide a solid starting point to build precooked developer dashboards that can be readily utilized by software companies.},

abstract = { In response to COVID-19, a vast number of visualizations have been created to communicate information to the public. Information exposure in a public health crisis can impact people’s attitudes towards and responses to the crisis and risks, and ultimately the trajectory of a pandemic. As such, there is a need for work that documents, organizes, and investigates what COVID-19 visualizations have been presented to the public. We address this gap through an analysis of 668 COVID-19 visualizations. We present our findings through a conceptual framework derived from our analysis, that examines who, (uses) what data, (to communicate) what messages, in what form, under what circumstances in the context of COVID-19 crisis visualizations. We provide a set of factors to be considered within each component of the framework. We conclude with directions for future crisis visualization research.},

@article{ivankovic,
 abstract = {Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the development of dashboards as dynamic, visual tools for communicating COVID-19 data has surged worldwide. Dashboards can inform decision-making and support behavior change. To do so, they must be actionable. The features that constitute an actionable dashboard in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been rigorously assessed. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the characteristics of public web-based COVID-19 dashboards by assessing their purpose and users (``why''), content and data (``what''), and analyses and displays (``how'' they communicate COVID-19 data), and ultimately to appraise the common features of highly actionable dashboards. Methods: We conducted a descriptive assessment and scoring using nominal group technique with an international panel of experts (n=17) on a global sample of COVID-19 dashboards in July 2020. The sequence of steps included multimethod sampling of dashboards; development and piloting of an assessment tool; data extraction and an initial round of actionability scoring; a workshop based on a preliminary analysis of the results; and reconsideration of actionability scores followed by joint determination of common features of highly actionable dashboards. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to explore the findings by research question. Results: A total of 158 dashboards from 53 countries were assessed. Dashboards were predominately developed by government authorities (100/158, 63.0{\%}) and were national (93/158, 58.9{\%}) in scope. We found that only 20 of the 158 dashboards (12.7{\%}) stated both their primary purpose and intended audience. Nearly all dashboards reported epidemiological indicators (155/158, 98.1{\%}), followed by health system management indicators (85/158, 53.8{\%}), whereas indicators on social and economic impact and behavioral insights were the least reported (7/158, 4.4{\%} and 2/158, 1.3{\%}, respectively). Approximately a quarter of the dashboards (39/158, 24.7{\%}) did not report their data sources. The dashboards predominately reported time trends and disaggregated data by two geographic levels and by age and sex. The dashboards used an average of 2.2 types of displays (SD 0.86); these were mostly graphs and maps, followed by tables. To support data interpretation, color-coding was common (93/158, 89.4{\%}), although only one-fifth of the dashboards (31/158, 19.6{\%}) included text explaining the quality and meaning of the data. In total, 20/158 dashboards (12.7{\%}) were appraised as highly actionable, and seven common features were identified between them. Actionable COVID-19 dashboards (1) know their audience and information needs; (2) manage the type, volume, and flow of displayed information; (3) report data sources and methods clearly; (4) link time trends to policy decisions; (5) provide data that are ``close to home''; (6) break down the population into relevant subgroups; and (7) use storytelling and visual cues. Conclusions: COVID-19 dashboards are diverse in the why, what, and how by which they communicate insights on the pandemic and support data-driven decision-making. To leverage their full potential, dashboard developers should consider adopting the seven actionability features identified.},

	abstract = {Background Governments across the WHO European Region prioritized dashboards for reporting COVID-19 data. The ubiquitous use of dashboards for public reporting is novel. This study explores the development of COVID-19 dashboards during the pandemic{\textquoteright}s first year and common barriers, enablers and lessons from the experiences of teams responsible for their development.Methods Multiple methods were applied to identify and recruit COVID-19 dashboard teams using a purposive, quota sampling approach. Semi-structured group interviews were conducted between April{\textendash} June 2021. Using elaborative coding and thematic analysis, descriptive and explanatory themes were derived from interview data. A validation workshop with study participants was held in June 2021.Results Eighty informants, representing 33 national COVID-19 dashboard teams across the WHO European Region participated. Most dashboards were launched swiftly in the first months of the pandemic, between February{\textendash}May 2020. The urgency, intense workload, limited human resources, data and privacy constraints, and public scrutiny were common to the initial development stage. Themes related to barriers or enablers were identified pertaining to the pre-pandemic context, pandemic itself, people and processes, software, data, and users. Lessons emerged around the themes of simplicity, trust, partnership, software and data, and change.Conclusions COVID-19 dashboards were developed in a learning-by-doing approach. The experiences of teams signal initial under-preparedness was compensated by high-level political endorsement, the professionalism of teams, accelerated data improvements, and immediate support of commercial software solutions. To leverage the full potential of dashboards, investments are needed at team-, national- and pan-European-level.Competing Interest StatementThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.
